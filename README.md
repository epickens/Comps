# Comps
Some work I did for my Carleton Math Comps

My comps project focused on learning about the Scenario Approach to Optimization

In this git repo you'll find a small amount of code I translated from Matlab to Python
+ Original code can be found here: http://www.algocare.it/GEM-BALLS/
+ All credit to the original authors of the code and paper describing the gem classifier

I've also added a number of features to this example classifier to show some possible future directions things could be taken. The features added include:
+ Bagging
+ Boosting 
+ Pruning
+ Ensemble creation
+ A toy visualization
